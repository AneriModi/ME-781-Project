'''
categorical_cols: list of names of columns of dataframe that are categorical in nature
continuousvariables: list of names of columns of dataframe that are continuous numeric in nature
'''

'''
X: dataset containing records with features as the columns 
Y: list of corresponding responses of the customer
'''

'''
X_train, Y_training: training dataset 
X_test, Y_test: testing dataset
X_extra, Y_extra: dataset that remains after forming the above two. Due to insufficient computational power, the entire dataset could not be taken into account.
'''

'''
downsampled: dataframe with downsampled majority along with the minority class, i.e., after resampling to deal with the largely skewed dataset
'''

'''
classifier_svc: initialisation of the SVC model used for training, with hyperparameters as C=10 and kernel=poly. Hyperparameter tuning was done by trying combinations of kernel=[poly, rbf] and C=[0.1, 1, 10], to see which gave the best accuracy.
'''

'''
Y_pred: the predicted label ('Response') for the test dataset (X_test)
'''

'''
disp: Initialization of confusion matrix display to observe the precision and recall of the two classes
