'''
train_df: training split of images
test_df: testing split of images (0.3)

'''
ImageDataGenerator: generates batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation

	'''
	Argument: preprocessing_function= preprocess_input as imported from MobileNet_v2 application

'''

'''
train_gen: imports and scales the training images
val_gen: imports and scales the validation images (split=0.2)
test_gen: imports the testing images

'''
model: MobileNetV2 model architecture is used, pertained on the ImageNet database
'''

'''
compile(): the model is configured with optimiser [adam], loss [categorical cross entropy] and metric [accuracy]
'''

'''
my_callbacks: initialise callbacks argument with an early stopping condition based on validation accuracy to prevent overfitting
