'''
data: pandas dataframe with three columns ['Unnamed:0', 'image','classes'], with unique image path as values for 'image' column and vehicle damage label as value for 'classes' column
'''

'''
edit_image_path():
	'''
	input: string the path needs to be attached to
	output: the concatenated string of path and input
	'''
'''

'''
train_df: training split of images
test_df: testing split of images (0.3)
'''

'''
ImageDataGenerator: generates batches of tensor image data with real-time data augmentation

	'''
	Argument: preprocessing_function= preprocess_input as imported from MobileNet_v2 application
	'''
'''

'''
train_gen: imports and scales the training images
val_gen: imports and scales the validation images (split=0.2)
test_gen: imports the testing images
'''

'''
model: MobileNetV2 model architecture is used, pertained on the ImageNet database
'''

'''
compile(): the model is configured with optimiser [adam], loss [categorical cross entropy] and metric [accuracy]
'''

'''
my_callbacks: initialise callbacks argument with an early stopping condition based on validation accuracy to prevent overfitting
'''

'''
history: fitting of model onto train_gen, over 50 epochs subject to callbacks over validation sets
'''

'''
results: model evaluation and metric display on the test dataset
'''

'''
labels: list of predicted class labels of test images
